# CSS Flag Project

This project is about creating a flag design using CSS.

The flag consists of a red background with a blue stripe in the middle and a white circle at the center with some text.

The flag is created using HTML and CSS.

The HTML structure consists of:
- a `div` element with the class "flag" to represent the overall flag,
- a `div` element with the class "blue-stripe" to represent the blue stripe, and
- a `div` element with the class "white-circle" to represent the white circle with text.

The CSS styles define the dimensions, colors, and positioning of the flag elements.<br>
The flag has a width of 300 pixels and a height of 200 pixels with a red background color. <br>
The blue stripe has a height of 100 pixels and is positioned vertically in the middle of the flag using absolute positioning and the transform property.<br>

The white circle has a width and height of 80 pixels, a white background color, and a border-radius of 50% to create a circular shape.<br>
It is positioned at the center of the flag using absolute positioning and the transform property. <br>
The text inside the white circle is centered using flexbox.<br>

Overall, this project demonstrates how to create a simple flag design using HTML and CSS, with various techniques such as positioning, transforms, and flexbox.<br >
